# StriatalBeatFrequency-Model
As a part of end-semester project for the course Introduction to Neural and Cognitive Modelling, our team (of two) has analysed the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model that aims to explain the perception of time - to some extent - inside the brain. A potential direction for further exploration has also been looked at.
